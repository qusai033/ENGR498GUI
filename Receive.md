### **Title**  
**Empatica EmbracePlus: Data Processing and AI Model for Predictive Analysis**  

---

### **Introduction**  
The **Empatica EmbracePlus** wearable device provides a comprehensive set of physiological and behavioral data, such as Electrodermal Activity (EDA), temperature, pulse rate, and accelerometry. By analyzing this data, we aim to develop an AI prediction model capable of detecting specific physiological states and events. This poster outlines our workflow for processing sensor data and applying machine learning techniques to predict events such as **heart flashes** or other health-related anomalies.

### **Data Collection and Processing**  
1. **Data Sources**:  
   - Empatica EmbracePlus collects data at **one-minute intervals** for 15 sensor readings:  
     - **Accelerometer**, **EDA**, **Pulse Rate**, **Respiratory Rate**, **Skin Temperature**, **Activity Classification**, etc.  

2. **Raw Data Processing**:  
   - Sensor data is stored in **Avro binary files** in an AWS S3 bucket.  
   - A **Python pipeline** processes these files into human-readable formats for analysis.  

3. **Metrics Extraction**:  
   - Data is segmented into **30-second windows** with min, max, mean, and standard deviation metrics.  
   - Pre- and post-event tagging is applied over **five windows** (2.5 minutes before and after events).  

4. **Key Processed Metrics**:  
   - Electrodermal Activity (EDA)  
   - Skin Temperature  
   - Accelerometer-based activity counts  
   - Pulse Rate Variability (PRV)

### **AI Model for Prediction**  
We develop a machine learning model to predict specific events (e.g., **heart flashes**):  

1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - **Labeled data**: Events are tagged (e.g., periods before, during, and after a heart flash).  
   - **Feature Engineering**: Extract meaningful features like EDA changes, temperature variations, and pulse rate anomalies.  

2. **Model Development**:  
   - **Supervised Learning**: Train models using labeled data to classify events or predict their occurrence.  
   - Features include:  
     - EDA trends (peaks, changes in conductance)  
     - Pulse rate variability and accelerometer standard deviation  
     - Body position and activity classification.  

3. **Prediction Workflow**:  
   - **Input**: Sensor time-series data  
   - **Output**: Event probability (e.g., onset of physiological anomalies)

### **Results and Applications**  
1. **Preliminary Results**:  
   - EDA and PRV showed significant changes leading up to events, providing critical insights for prediction.  
   - Machine learning models demonstrated **high accuracy** in detecting event windows based on physiological data.  

2. **Applications**:  
   - **Health Monitoring**: Early detection of stress, seizures, or cardiac anomalies.  
   - **Personalized Therapy**: Inform clinicians about physiological trends to improve interventions.  
   - **Wearable Integration**: Real-time predictions for remote patient monitoring systems.  

---

### **Future Directions**  
- **AI Refinement**: Improve accuracy by incorporating more advanced models (e.g., LSTM or transformer networks for time-series data).  
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Develop pipelines for on-device data processing and real-time feedback.  
- **Broader Applications**: Expand AI predictions to identify other health markers such as sleep disturbances, stress levels, or movement abnormalities.
