To effectively use the voltage decay data for ARULE and produce meaningful prognostic information, here's a step-by-step breakdown based on your document and requirements:

### 1. **Understanding ARULE Input Requirements**
   - ARULE requires **Feature Data (FD)** derived from **Condition-Based Data (CBD)**.
   - FD should represent a characteristic signature correlated with degradation or failure, such as changes in capacitance inferred from voltage decay.

### 2. **Generating Feature Data**
   - Use **voltage decay data** to create FD by identifying degradation patterns.
   - Calculate derived metrics, such as:
     - **Delta T**: Time between voltage samples showing significant change.
     - **FDZ**: Nominal Feature Data value, often an average or maximum based on stable conditions.
     - **FDC**: Baseline Feature Data value indicating no degradation.
   - ARULE processes this FD to predict metrics like Remaining Useful Life (RUL).

### 3. **Feature Data Extraction Process**
   - Apply **filtering and noise reduction** to raw voltage data to remove irrelevant fluctuations.
   - Identify trends (e.g., logarithmic decay) to calculate features like:
     - **Exponential decay constants**.
     - **Change rates over time**.

### 4. **Node Definition File**
   - Create an NDEF file defining input and processing parameters.
   - Key parameters:
     - `FDNM`: Noise margin for FD values.
     - `FDZ`: Calculated using statistical methods or engineering judgment.
     - `FDC`: Initial baseline derived from the data.
     - `FDNV`: Exponent in the FD equation, often determined by system behavior.

### 5. **Python Implementation for FD Generation**
Here’s a Python example to derive Feature Data from voltage decay:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load voltage decay data
data = pd.read_csv('voltage_decay.csv')  # Replace with actual file path

# Assume columns are "Time" and "Voltage"
data['Delta T'] = data['Time'].diff().fillna(0)

# Calculate FD using a basic model
baseline_voltage = data['Voltage'].iloc[0]  # Initial voltage as baseline
data['FD'] = (baseline_voltage - data['Voltage']) / baseline_voltage  # Example FD calculation

# Calculate statistics for NDEF
fdz = data['FD'].mean()
fdc = data['FD'].iloc[0]  # Initial FD as FDC

# Output results
print(f"FDZ (Mean FD): {fdz:.2f}")
print(f"FDC (Initial FD): {fdc:.2f}")

# Save feature data for ARULE
data.to_csv('feature_data.csv', index=False)
```

### 6. **Transforming FD for ARULE**
   - Normalize FD values to match ARULE input requirements.
   - Map values to appropriate models (linear, convex, or concave) using ARULE’s `FDNV` parameter.

### 7. **Validation with ARULE**
   - Input the generated feature data (`feature_data.csv`) into ARULE.
   - Verify output predictions (e.g., RUL, PH) against known system behavior.

### 8. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Adjust parameters in the node definition file (e.g., `FDNV`, `FDZ`) for improved accuracy.
   - Use real-world data to validate and refine the model.

### Next Steps
- Let me know if you need Python code for more specific calculations (e.g., exponential fits, noise filtering).
- Once your FD is ready, ensure the node definition file matches ARULE requirements for seamless integration.
