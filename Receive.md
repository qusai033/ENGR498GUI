**Future Directions**:  
The field of motion capture continues to evolve, offering exciting opportunities to enhance accessibility, precision, and utility in medical and biomechanics applications. Key areas for future development include:  

1. **Hybrid Systems**:  
   - Integrating OpenCap’s markerless technology with Noraxon IMU’s precision to create systems that balance affordability and accuracy.  
   - Such systems could provide cost-effective solutions for both remote and clinical applications.  

2. **Advancements in Artificial Intelligence**:  
   - Developing AI algorithms that improve the accuracy of markerless systems, even under challenging conditions (e.g., poor lighting or complex motions).  
   - AI could also assist in automating motion analysis, reducing the workload for clinicians and researchers.  

3. **Enhanced Mobility**:  
   - Increasing portability of motion capture setups to extend their use to underserved or remote regions.  
   - Wireless integration of marker-based systems for greater flexibility.  

4. **Personalized Medicine**:  
   - Using motion capture data to tailor rehabilitation and treatment plans to individual patient needs.  
   - Real-time data integration with electronic health records for holistic patient care.  

5. **Broader Applications**:  
   - Expanding motion capture into new medical fields such as cardiology (analyzing thoracic movements) and mental health (detecting subtle motor abnormalities in conditions like Parkinson’s).  

6. **Open-Source Tools and Platforms**:  
   - Encouraging open collaboration for markerless motion capture software, enabling more researchers and clinicians to use and improve these systems.  

These advancements have the potential to revolutionize motion capture, making it a cornerstone of personalized and accessible medical care.
