### **Abstract (200 Words)**  
*"Motion capture technology is revolutionizing medical applications by enabling accurate analysis of movement. This study explores two distinct systems: OpenCap, a markerless motion capture platform utilizing AI and depth-sensing cameras, and Noraxon IMU, a marker-based system that collects precise kinematic data through wearable sensors. We compare these technologies across key dimensions such as cost, setup complexity, accuracy, and usability in clinical and remote settings. OpenCap’s accessible approach holds potential for remote physical therapy and sports medicine, while Noraxon’s high precision makes it indispensable in controlled laboratory environments. Together, these systems demonstrate the versatility and growing impact of motion capture in enhancing patient care and advancing biomechanics research. Future directions suggest integrating both approaches for hybrid solutions that maximize usability and accuracy. This poster highlights the strengths and limitations of each system and their applications in medical and research contexts."*
