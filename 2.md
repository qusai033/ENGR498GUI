### **Title**  
**Empatica EmbracePlus: Data Processing and AI Model for Heart Flash Prediction**  

---

### **Introduction**  
The **Empatica EmbracePlus** wearable device provides a wealth of physiological and behavioral data through multiple sensors, including **Blood Volume Pulse (BVP)**, Electrodermal Activity (EDA), and Skin Temperature. This project focuses on using **BVP-derived heart rate metrics** combined with other sensor data to develop an AI model capable of predicting **heart flashes**—sudden, short-term physiological events. This poster outlines the data processing workflow and the machine learning approach behind this predictive system.

### **Data Collection and Processing**  
1. **Data Sources**:  
   - Empatica EmbracePlus collects 15 sensor readings, with a focus on:  
     - **Blood Volume Pulse (BVP)** for heart rate extraction.  
     - Electrodermal Activity (EDA) for stress-related conductance changes.  
     - Accelerometer, Skin Temperature, and Pulse Rate Variability (PRV).  

2. **Raw Data Processing**:  
   - Sensor data is stored in **Avro binary files** in an AWS S3 bucket.  
   - A **Python pipeline** processes these files into structured formats for analysis.  

3. **Metrics Extraction**:  
   - **BVP Metrics**:  
     - Heart rate trends, variability (HRV), and peak detection.  
   - **EDA and Temperature Metrics**:  
     - Min, max, and mean changes in 30-second windows.  
   - **Tagged Events**:  
     - Data segmented into **five 30-second windows** (2.5 minutes) before and after tagged events.  

4. **Key Processed Metrics**:  
   - Heart Rate (from BVP).  
   - Heart Rate Variability (HRV).  
   - EDA Peaks and Trends.  
   - Temperature and Accelerometer Activity.

### **AI Model for Heart Flash Prediction**  
**Goal**: Develop an AI model to detect and predict heart flashes using multimodal sensor data.  

1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - **BVP Focus**: Extract heart rate (HR) and HRV metrics from BVP signals to identify early physiological changes.  
   - **Feature Engineering**: Include trends and peaks in EDA, HR changes, and accelerometry-derived activity levels.  

2. **Model Development**:  
   - **Supervised Learning**: Train models (e.g., Random Forest, LSTM) using labeled data for event classification.  
   - **Key Features**:  
     - BVP-derived HR and HRV metrics (short-term variations are key indicators).  
     - EDA conductance changes (peaks associated with stress or arousal).  
     - Temperature fluctuations and accelerometer standard deviations.  

3. **Prediction Workflow**:  
   - **Input**: Time-series data from BVP, EDA, and other sensors.  
   - **Output**: Event probability score for heart flash prediction.

### **Results and Applications**  
1. **Preliminary Results**:  
   - **BVP-derived HR and HRV** were highly predictive of heart flashes, showing noticeable trends up to 2 minutes before events.  
   - EDA and temperature metrics provided complementary signals, improving model accuracy.  

2. **Applications**:  
   - **Health Monitoring**: Early warning systems for stress, anxiety, or cardiac anomalies.  
   - **Rehabilitation**: Tracking physiological responses to therapeutic interventions.  
   - **Real-Time Wearable Alerts**: AI-driven predictions to notify users or clinicians of impending events.

### **Future Directions**  
1. **Advanced BVP Analysis**:  
   - Explore additional metrics like pulse transit time (PTT) or waveform morphology for deeper insights.  

2. **AI Refinement**:  
   - Use deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers) to better capture time-series dependencies.  

3. **Real-Time Implementation**:  
   - Build on-device AI models for live predictions using BVP and other sensor data.  

4. **Multimodal Integration**:  
   - Combine BVP with EDA, temperature, and accelerometer metrics for robust, real-time health monitoring.
